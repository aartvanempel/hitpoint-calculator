## D&D Hitpoint Calculator

[D&D Hitpoint Calculator](https://aartvanempel.github.io/hitpoint-calculator/ "D&D Hitpoint Calculator")

A tool for people who suck at math and want to track hitpoints in D&D battles, made with React and Redux Toolkit.

Especially as a DM, there is a lot of things to think about and keep track of during battles. I found it really helpfull to relieve some of the thinkwork by using this small tool on my phone next to my notepad. Players can also use it, just don't forget to write down your hitpoints at the end of a battle because the calculator currently won't save it.
